###Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One of the main challenges working on the Kickstarter data base was the variety of information that was displaid on it, and 

##Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
