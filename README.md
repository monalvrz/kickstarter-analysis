# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of the Project

This project is based on an analysis of data collected on Microsoft Excel from Kickstarter campaigns focused on the
promotion and funding of cultural projects. Specifically, the project focused on the review of the different variables
that could affect thefinancing of theater plays. 

## Purpose

The main purpose of the project is to help the client, Louise, to gain some information about the factors that could
determine that a Kickstarter campaign might be successful. Louise wants to start a crowdfunding campaing to help her fund her play "Fever", and she is estimatting a budget of over ten thousand dollars. 

## Analysis and Challenges

To conduct the analysis, the information within the database was organized and filtered to align with the characteristics
of Louise's campaign. A subcategory was generated to show only theater play campaigns and two main variables were
selected, launch dates and funding goals. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

A pivot chart was used to performe the analysis on the outcomes based on launch date. In order to do this, the "date
created conversion" was used to extract the extact month the campains were launched. In addition, the outcome variable was
added, which made it possible to identify the results of the campaigns according to the month in which they were launched.To better present the information a line chart was created, so we can see the

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

For the analysis on outcomes based on goals a graph was created in which the percentages of outcomes are presented based on the goals variable. On the x-axis we can see the ranges of money that the campaigns set out to obtain and on the y-axis the percentage of plays that achieved or did not achieve their objective according to their outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One of the main challenges working on the Kickstarter data base was the variety of information that was displaid on it.
Each campaign has its very specific context, according to the place, the amount of money that was proposed to be obtained,
as well as the category in which the project aligned. This makes it complex to analyze the probability of a campaign's
success or failure. 

Another difficulty of this project was the way in which the information could be presented. The database presented several
variables that together could confuse the person accessing the information and therefore the correct selection of
variables is essential. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date? From the analysis of plays based on launch dates it is possible to conclude that the best month to carry out a funding campaign is the month of May. On the other hand, October is the month with the worst results for financing plays.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? On the other hand, from the analysis of the outcomes based on goal, the most successful campaigns were those in the range of less than 1000. Those campaigns that were less successful were those that sought to raise a budget of 4,5000 to 49999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? One of the limitations of this database is the information we have on the campaigns that fall into the category of plays. Compared to other subcategories the information is limited which does not allow us to have a complex and complete scenario of the results of Kickstarter campaigns. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Subsequently, it would be interesting to create graphs that show other variables that cross the possibility of having a successful theater campaign in comparison with other subcategories.
